## My Footprint

 - My Footprint is a mobile lifestyle app that tracks where users 
 spend their time and helps them expand their footprint by getting 
 to know new people and places around them.

 - Have you ever asked yourself:
 - How much of my city do I really enjoy?
 - Why do I always run into the same people?
 - Why don't I ever exerience something new?
 - What am I missing out on?
